h1. 🧪 Wiki Migration Testing – Manual QA Log

h2. 📘 Purpose
To manually test and record what types of content (attachments, emojis, formatting, links, etc.) successfully migrate from on-prem GitHub wikis to GitHub SaaS.

h2. 🧭 1. How to Use This Page
For each tested repo/page, log:
* What was present in the origin wiki
* What made it to the destination
* Any specific failures (e.g. broken image, garbled emoji, bad link)

Use ✅ for success, ❌ for failure, ⚠️ for partial/missing, and 📝 in the “Notes” for details.
