# 🧪 Migration Test: Emojis, Special Characters & Code Blocks

Welcome to the **Migration Testing Wiki Page**. This file contains various elements that commonly cause issues during migrations, including emoji rendering, special Unicode characters, and code formatting.

---

## 😀 Emojis

Check that all these render properly:

- ✅ Success  
- ❌ Failure  
- 🚀 Launch  
- 🔥 Fire  
- 🐍 Python  
- 💻 Developer  
- 📎 Attachment  
- 📘 Documentation  

---

## 🧬 Special Characters

Test common characters from international text, math, and Greek letters:

- Accented characters: `é`, `ñ`, `ü`, `ç`, `ø`, `å`  
- Smart punctuation: `“quotes”`, `— em dash —`, `– en dash –`  
- Math symbols: `π`, `∑`, `∞`, `∆`, `√`, `≈`, `≠`  
- Currencies: `$`, `€`, `¥`, `₹`  
- Others: `©`, `™`, `§`, `¶`, `•`

## 💻 Code Blocks

### Bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Migration test: bash code block ✅"
```

### Python

```python
def hello():
    print("👋 Hello from the Python block!")
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
const emojis = ['🔥', '✅', '💻'];
emojis.forEach(e => console.log(`Testing ${e}`));
```

### Inline Code

You can also use inline code like `print("Hello World")` to test simple formatting.

## 📌 Final Notes

If any of the above fails to render in the migrated version:
- Double check encoding (UTF-8 recommended)
- Ensure emoji fonts are supported in your environment
- Look out for lost formatting in fenced code blocks
